# Student-Score-Prediction
# 📈 Student Score Prediction – ML Regression Project  
This project is part of my 30-Day Machine Learning Challenge with Elevvo Internship.   The goal is to predict students' exam scores based on the number of study hours using linear and polynomial regression.  ---
💡 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to predict students' exam scores based on various factors influencing academic performance, with a primary focus on study hours. By analyzing key variables such as study time, attendance, previous grades, and socio-economic factors, we aim to build a reliable predictive model using Linear Regression. This model can help educators identify at-risk students early and support data-driven interventions to improve learning outcomes.
